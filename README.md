BBM provides a set of R functions to fit a bounded brownian motion (BBM) model of evolution to phylogenetic comparative data using maximum likelihood. In the BBM model, a continuous trait evolves under brownian motion with a constant evolutionary rate, but between two reflective bounds.

These functions only depend on the {ape} package in R and likelihoods are compatible with those of other models fitted by the 'fitContinuous' function in package {geiger}.

Functions were written by Florian Boucher and Vincent DÃ©mery.
